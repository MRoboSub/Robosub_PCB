# Hall Effect LED Board
This is designed to use a US5881LSE hall effect switch along with a standalone LED.

A 10k pull-up resistor is used on the output to avoid floating, but usually its already done on the microcontroller.

# Plans
- Possibly use 555 timer for flashing LED
- Include a power indicator

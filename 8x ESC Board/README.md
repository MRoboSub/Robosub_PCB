# 8x ESC Board
This is designed to hold 8 of the BlueRobotics Basic ESC along with a Polulu Mini Maestro 12-Channel Servo Controller.

An indicator LED shows that the controller board is active. Each ESC has a fuse and traces sufficient for any current needed. 

When assembling each board, the exposed copper traces need to be covered with a thick layer of solder tin. This acts as a fairly cheap way to handle high currents. Previously, 8 oz copper was used for the board which was expensive, so this one uses 2 oz copper.

# 1.0 IN-PROGRESS
I have ordered the parts for implementation testing before designing a PCB.

# Battery Voltage Display
Designed to display the current battery voltage along with an indicator if voltage levels exceed a threshold.

# Plans
- AtTiny85 for built-in signal processing
- Possibly use 78L05 (or LM317 for higher current) for 5v regulator
- 2 LEDS, one for optimal voltage and one for beyond threshold voltage.
